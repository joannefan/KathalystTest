## Summary
This codebase implements a simple Task Manager application with the following main components and interactions:

1. Task: Represents individual tasks with title, description, and completion status.

2. TaskManager: Manages a list of tasks, allowing addition, viewing, and marking tasks as complete.

3. UserInterface: Handles displaying the menu and getting user input.

4. Main application (app.py): Orchestrates the program flow, integrating TaskManager and UserInterface to:
   - Display menu options
   - Process user choices
   - Add new tasks
   - View existing tasks
   - Mark tasks as completed
   - Exit the application

The application runs in a loop, continuously presenting options to the user until they choose to exit. It provides basic task management functionality through a command-line interface.
