## Summary
This code base implements a simple Task Manager application. It allows users to view tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and exit the application.

## Installation
The code does not appear to require any external dependencies, libraries, or packages to be installed to run in a local environment. It is a self-contained Python application.

## Steps to Run the Code
To build or run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Save the provided code in four separate files: `task.py`, `task_manager.py`, `user_interface.py`, and `app.py`.
2. Ensure all files are in the same directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are saved.
4. Run the `app.py` file using Python, e.g., `python app.py`.
5. The Task Manager application will start, and you can interact with it by selecting options from the menu.

Note: This code assumes you have Python installed on your system.
